0.04    2010-05-26

- Previous releases were missing some prereqs. Hopefully this one fixes that.


0.03    2010-05-25

- Anchors cannot contain anything but letters, numbers, and a few punctuation
  characters. An anchor must start with a letter. This module now generates
  spec-compliant anchors.


0.02    2010-05-25

- Added a compilation test, because if all tests are skipped cpan testers
  report it as a failure (which is its own wtf).


0.01    2010-05-24

- First release upon an unsuspecting world.
